# 🎒 CCHS Lost & Found Portal

A secure, moderated Lost & Found platform built for school environments.  
Designed to increase item return rates, reduce staff workload, and protect student privacy.

---

## 📌 What It Is

CCHS Lost & Found is a full-stack web application that modernizes how schools manage misplaced items.

It enables:

- Structured item reporting
- Advanced search & filtering
- Secure claim verification
- Admin moderation workflows
- Privacy-first communication

---

## ❗ Problem / Why

Schools process hundreds of misplaced items every semester.

Traditional systems rely on:

- Physical bins
- Paper logs
- Unsearchable spreadsheets
- Manual coordination

This leads to:

- Low return rates
- Poor visibility
- Privacy risks
- Staff inefficiency

This platform replaces that process with a secure, searchable, and moderated system.
